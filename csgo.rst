TERRORISTS
================================

Terrorists have the advantage of less expensive guns and fire grenandes, and
their guns often inflict more damage per shot than their good guy counterparts.

A disadvantage is that they have fewer weapons to choose from, and none of them
have silencers.

COUNTER-TERRORISTS
================================

Counter-Terrorists have the advantage of silenced guns, as well as having a
wider selection of guns overall. They also are more likely to have a tactical
advantage on many maps.

One of the disadvantages is having to purchase a defuse kit/hostage rescue kit,
which is an added cost every time you die.
